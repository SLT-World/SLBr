# SLBr
The new, clean and lightweight .NET Web browser

# Taking advantage of the powerful Chromium platform

SLBr uses the fast, light speed [**CEFSharp**](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp) which is a wrapper around the [**Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)**](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/master/) to render webpages.

# Important

# Questions
**What is the UI system that is used to create SLBr?**

SLBr uses the .NET [**Windows Presentation Forms**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/designers/getting-started-with-wpf) as the ui system.

**Why CEFSharp?**

[**CEFSharp**](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp) is well supported and has a large community, it's been around much longer than the Microsoft WebView2 and CEFSharp is more easy for my standard.

**Does SLBr send browsing habits to companies or tracks activities**

No, I have no idea how to do that.
