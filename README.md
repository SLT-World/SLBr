# SLBr
A fully-featured, fast and clean web browser made using the powerful .NET WPF and the fast Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) as the rendering engine.

I'm the maintainer, developer and owner of this application.

Where is the source code?

I haven't uploaded it, I'm still thinking if it's worth making the code public.
